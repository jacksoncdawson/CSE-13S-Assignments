# CSE13S-02 Winter 2024

With instructor Kerry Veenstra and TA Jessie Srinivas.
I put a lot of work into succeeding in this course, and am proud to have 

## Assignments

During my course, there were 7 total assignments. Each assignment has its own directory, which generally includes a Makefile, testing scripts, a pdf overviewing how to complete the assignment, a design document, and the code!

In earlier assignments, Makefiles were provided to us, but as the course progressed, we were expected to write our own Makefiles. 

I wrote all present tests, although I admit often I used the grading pipeline to check my code for correctness. 

I also wrote all of the design documents, using a provided template. This was my introduction to both writing design documents, and using LaTeX. I found working through my thoughts before diving into the code to be helpful, although this was not always the process I followed due to time restraints. Using LateX presented a learning curve, but I enjoyed working with it and ended up creating my "cheat-sheet" for a different class in LaTeX as well.

### Assignment 0: How to Write Tests

Assignment 0 tasked me with writing tests to identify bugs in several faulty calculator programs. I was only provided with binaries of the various implementations, so writing tests to run with the provided runner.sh was the best way to identify any given bug. I wrote a lot of tests, but overlooked a few simple edge cases that I should have tested for. 

I received an A on this assignment, and definitely learned a lot about bash scripting and working within a terminal.

### Assignment 1: Left, Right, and Center

For Assignment 1, I built a program that would simulate a game of "Left, Right, and Center". The game takes optional input parameters from the user to determine the number of "players" and/or the seed for the pseudo-random number generator to determine the outcome of each die "roll". 

I received a perfect score for this assignment, and learned about control flow, structs, enums, and some abstraction in C, among some other less prominent concepts.
